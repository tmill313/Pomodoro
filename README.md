## Design Choices

- **Tailwind CSS**: I like to use tailwind when I am trying to throw something together like this, after using it a few times the syntax makes a lot of sense and makes it quick/easy to use.
- **Redux Toolkit**: I used redux toolkit because I haven't used redux for a while and have heard this makes it not as painful and was happy with it once I got the boilerplate setup.
